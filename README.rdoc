I wanted to create an open sourced site powered by the love and joy that is Ruby on Rails. Combined with the ease and use of Github and we have a delightful platform to collaborate. Something not working? Dislike my HEX code choices? Fork this project and change it yourself. Then send a pull request and I'll make sure it ends up on the live version.
== Getting started
First, fork the project.

To get the database running (MySQL) simply run

bundle exec rake db:create

bundle exec rake db:migrate
